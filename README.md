# Udacity-DeepLearningND-P5-Deploy-a-Sentiment-Analysis-Model
Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model using Amazon SageMaker on AWS. We need to build the model, deploy it, and create a gateway for accessing this model from a website.

## Project Outline
1. Download or otherwise retrieve the data.
2. Process / Prepare the data.
3. Upload the processed data to S3.
4. Train a chosen model.
5. Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).
6. Deploy the trained model.
7. Use the deployed model.
